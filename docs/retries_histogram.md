# Retries Histogram

## Write
### Places where RetryStats are modified
 * `Broker.start` -> `handle_session_started`: All respondents are started from here.
 This is the only place where respondents are **added** to the histogram.

 * `Runtime.Survey.sync_step` -> `handle_next_action`: All respondent interactions go through here.
 Depending on survey response (whether is a `:reply` or an `:end`) and `mode`,
 respondent is **reallocated** in the histogram or **removed** from it.
 This is the happy-way of removing a respondent from the histogram, because the respondent completed the survey.

 * `Session.retry`: where respondents are effectively retried (contacted, it's retries decreased and attempts increased)
 Always, in this case, the respondent is **reallocated** in the histogram.

 * `Session.switch_to_fallback_mode`: when a respondent fallbacks to another `mode`.
 This always means the respondent is **reallocated** in the histogram.

 * `VerboiceChannel.callback(path=status)`: when verboice status is `failed`, `busy`, or `no-answer`, the call could not
  get through or was interrupted.
  This means the respondent is no longer active, so it must be **reallocated** from
  an `ivr-active` slot to a `non-ivr-active` one.

 * `Session.timeout [no retries left]`: Session is terminated, so respondent is **removed** from the histogram

 * `Runtime.Survey.channel_failed [no retries left & no fallback mode left]`: Respondent is marked as `failed`
 so is **removed** from the histogram.

### Considerations

* **ivr**: when call expires (verboice couldn't call the respondent in the given time-window), surveda considers the respondent is still active.
Respondent is re-contacted, **but kept in the same histogram-slot.**

* **sms**: when a respondent replies a message its timeout is reset and the attempt is not increased

## Read

* **sms**: the respondent is considered `active` (active-attempt histogram column)
if its `retry_stat.retry_stat_time` is in _n_ hours being _n_ the delay between attempts

* **sms**: when a respondent replies a message goes back to the current-attempt active slot

* **ivr**: the `non-ivr-active` respondents that have _n_ hours to the next attempt (being _n_ the delay between attempts)
are shown in the ivr-active slot until the hour expires
